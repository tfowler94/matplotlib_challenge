### Analysis

Based on this 45 day test, Capomulin is the second most reliable drug to administer for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) slightly behind Ramicane given its mean, median, var, std dev, and sem.

A random test of mouse L509 shows that tumor volume decreases by 8 mm3 between days 20 and 35, indicating the potential efficacy window.

The heavier the mice, the less effective Capomulin becomes, indicating a dose adjusment based on weight.
